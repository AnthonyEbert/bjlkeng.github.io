.. type: text

**Preface**: *Second post and I'm already off topic according to my subtitle.  I
do have another post that is more topic appropriate but it's been pretty hectic
so I haven't had time to finish it.  Although, investing is definitely a kind of
technical topic involving data/numbers, so one could argue it is still on
topic.  And argue I shall!*

A lot of smart people I meet frequently mention that they have no clue about
investing or other related financial matters.  They're quite right that modern
finance can get quite complicated like `option pricing models
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model>`_ that require
differential equations and other such complicated maths.  But as in most things
a little common sense goes a long way.  So I want to share an analogy that I
think will help people understand the only rational way to invest aka value
investing.  In particular, I'm talking most about investing in publicly traded
common stocks but the general idea applies to most asset classes.


**Stocks: An Emotional Roller Coaster**

There's a huge disconnect between *how* a stock certificate is perceived and *what*
it actually represents.  How it is usually perceived is as a number.  A number
that takes you (usually without asking) on an emotional roller coaster that gets
more exciting the fast it goes up or down.  What it actually is a part ownership
in the underlying company.  That is, you are entitled to dividends and other
assets of the company in proportion to your ownership stake.  In the limit, you
own the company.

So I think most people can rationally follow along with this idea.
Stocks = part ownership of a company.  But how can I make money off of it?
This is where it gets tricky.  Remember the emotional roller coaster that I
mentioned before?  Well for many people investing is kind of like trying to do
math while *riding* a roller coaster -- not really an easy task.  But for most
people they already have a good intuition on how it *should* work.  Let's
take a example from real life [1]_ and see how some common sense really matches up
with a rational way to invest.


**From Buying Groceries to Investing**

Most people generally know the price of common items they buy.  Things such as
toilet paper, laundry detergent or carton of milk, they have a general idea of
what the price should be.  For me (at least in my area), I've have a good idea
of what a 12-packs of Coke Zero costs.  The price varies, regular is $4.99 - $5.99,
sometimes when it's on sale it usually can go down to $3.99, and once in a blue
moon it will go down to $2.99 per case.  

Now imagine that you could actually return this case of Coke whenever you want,
but not just for the price you paid, for the *current* sale price of the case.
So if you bought it on sale for $3.99 last week, you could refund it and get
back $5.99 this week when the sale is over.  In this hypothetical example,
you've actually made $5.99 - $3.99 = $2.00.  
A return of about 50% ($2.00 / $3.99)!  If only investing were so easy.

Although contrived, this example shows a key idea.  You have some sense of what
the case of Coke is worth.  That is, $5.99 is over paying for a case of coke,
while $3.99 is a pretty good deal.  This is directly analagous to investing in
stocks.  If you can have a pretty good idea when a stock is on "sale", then you
can buy it, wait a little bit until the sale is over, then sell it for profit.

Now here's the part where people get lost.  "Sale" means different things to
different people.  The common way to determine if something is on sale is to 
look at the history of its price and see when it's low relative to regular
price.  People do invest using a much more complicated version of this called
`Technical Analayis` where they only look at the price chart (and other related
things like volume) to determine whether or not to buy/sell.  It doesn't make
much sense to me so I won't talk much about it.

The other big school of thought is called `Fundamental
Analysis` where you look at the actual characteristics of the business (like
how much money they make) and estimate what it's worth.  The key idea here
is that when determining if something is on "sale", we should have some
rational line of economic reasoning to back it up.  Let's go back to our example
of a case of Coke.

**The Cost of a Can of Coke**

Imagine you really wanted to understand (using "Fundamentals") what a case of
Coke was worth.  So you call up your buddy who works at Coke, talk to him and
his friends, and you estimate that it costs Coca-Cola about $0.15 for each can
of Coke (including cost of water, syrup, aluminum, packaging, distribution).
Further, you also call up your buddy at the grocery store and he tells you that
he buys a case of Coke from Coca-Cola for between $2.00 and $3.00 per case ($0.16 -
$0.25 per can) depending on what kind of deal he can work out with Coca-Cola.

Now, we have a good idea of what the minimum price you would *ever* get a case
of Coke for given several assumptions:

* Assume Coca-Cola makes no money, grocer makes no money (just cost of
  maufacturing/distribution): 

  * $0.15/can * 12 cans = $1.80/case

* Assume Coca-Cola sells to grocer at historic low price ($2.00; $0.016/can profit), and grocer has no profit: 

  * $2.00/case

* Assume Coca-Cola sells at their average price to grocer ($2.50/case; profit: $0.058/can), grocer wants to make $0.50/case (profit: $0.042/can):

  * $2.50 + $0.5 = $3.00

For these examples


**Real World is much Much Harder**

.. [1] Warren Buffett has a similar real-life example in this fortune `article <http://fortune.com/2014/02/24/buffetts-annual-letter-what-you-can-learn-from-my-real-estate-investments/>`_ involving a farm but at least for a city boy like me, it's a bit harder for me to relate.
