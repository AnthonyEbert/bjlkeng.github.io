Before we begin talking about (statistical) hypotheses, it's important to clear
up some common statistics terms and ideas that are sometimes casually thrown
around.  I, for one, did not have a rigorous understanding of these concepts
and definitely not a very good intuitive sense.  Let's try to explain it with
enough math to get a good intuition about the subject.

The first big idea is that all data (or observations) has a "true" [1]_ probability

A statistical model :math:`\mathfrak{F}`
