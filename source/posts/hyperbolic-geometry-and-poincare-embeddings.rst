This post is finally going to get back to some ML related topics.
In fact, the original reason I took that whole math-y detour in the previous
posts was to the more deeply understand this topic, it turns out trying to
under tensor calculus and differential geometry (even to a basic level) takes a
while!  Who knew?  In any case, we're getting back to our regularly scheduled program.

In this post, I'm going to write about a different model of space called
hyperbolic space.  The reason why this abstract math is of interest is because
there has been a surge of research showing its application in various fields,
chief among them is the paper by Facebook [1], which discusses how to utilize
a model of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical relationships.
As usual, I'll cover some of the math weighting more towards intuition, and
also play around with some implementations to help understand the topic a bit
more.  Don't worry, this time I'll try much harder not going to go down the
rabbit hole of trying to explain all math, rather I'll just stick with a more
intuitive explanation with a sprinkle of math.

|h2| Curvature |h2e|

To begin this discussion, we have to first understand something about
`curvature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature>`__.  There are all
kinds of curvature to talk about whether they be on curves, or surfaces (or
hypersurfaces).  With the latter having many different variants.  The basic
idea behind all these different types are that **curvature** is some measure by
which a geometric object deviates from a flat plane, or in the case of a curve,
deviates from a straight line.  

As a side note, there can be **extrinsic curvature** which is defined for
objects embedded in another space (usually Euclidean).  Alternatively, there is
a concept of **intrinsic curvature**, which is defined in terms of lengths of a
curve within a Riemannian manifold, i.e. it is defined independently of any
embedding.  We won't go into all the details but those two terms might come up
when you're reading further.


|h3| Gaussian Curvature |h3e|

To begin, let's start with Gaussian curvature, which is a measure of curvature
for surfaces (2D manifolds).  Let's take a look at Figure 1 which shows three
the three different types of `Gaussian curvature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature>`__.

This gives us a good intuition about what it means to have curvature.  Starting
with the centre diagram (zero curvature), we see that a cylindrical surface has
*flat or zero* in one dimension (along its length) and curved around the other
dimension, resulting in zero curvature.  Moving to the right, the sphere on has
curvature along its to axis in the *same direction*, resulting in a positive
curvature.  And to the left, we see the saddle sheet has curvature along its
axis in *different directions*, resulting in negative curvature.
In fact, the Gaussian curvature is the product of its two 
`principal curvatures <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_curvature>`__, 
which correspond to our intuitive definition of curving along its two different
axes.

Curvature isn't a uniform property of a surface, it's actually defined point-wise.
Figure 2 shows a Torus that has all three different types of Gaussian curvature.
We won't go deeply into the definition of Gaussian curvature because it's a pain but
I think this should probably give some decent intuition on it.

  Figure 2: A torus' surface has all three types of curvature.  The outside has positive curvuature (red); the inside has negative curvature (blue); and a ring on the top and bottom of the torus have zero curvature (yellow-orange) (source: `Stackexchange <https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/61409/computing-gaussian-curvature>`__).

Gaussian curvature gives us great intuition on 2D surfaces but what about
higher dimension?  The concept of "axes" gets a bit more muddy, so we need an
alternate way to define things.  One way is to look at the "deviation" of
certain geometric objects such as a triangle.  Figure 3 shows how a triangle on
a surface of differently curved surfaces behave.

  :align: center

  Figure 3: Deviation of a triangle under the three different types of Gaussian Curvature (source: `Science4All <http://www.science4all.org/article/brazuca/>`__).

We can see that in our flat geometry (centre), a triangle's angles add up to
exactly :math:`180^{\circ}`; on positive curvature surfaces (right), it adds up
to more than :math:`180^{\circ}`; on negative curvature surfaces (left), it
adds up to less than :math:`180^{\circ}`.  Measuring how an object's behavior
differs from flat space is (one way) how we're going to generalize curvature to
higher dimensions in the next subsection.
