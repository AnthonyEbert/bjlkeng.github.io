This post is finally going to get back to some ML related topics.
In fact, the original reason I took that whole math-y detour in the previous
posts was to the more deeply understand this topic, it turns out trying to
under tensor calculus and differential geometry (even to a basic level) takes a
while!  Who knew?  In any case, we're getting back to our regularly scheduled program.

In this post, I'm going to write about a different model of space called
hyperbolic space.  The reason why this abstract math is of interest is because
there has been a surge of research showing its application in various fields,
chief among them is the paper by Facebook [1], which discusses how to utilize
a model of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical relationships.
As usual, I'll cover some of the math weighting more towards intuition, and
also play around with some implementations to help understand the topic a bit
more.  Don't worry, this time I'll try much harder not going to go down the
rabbit hole of trying to explain all math, rather I'll just stick with a more
intuitive explanation with a sprinkle of math.
