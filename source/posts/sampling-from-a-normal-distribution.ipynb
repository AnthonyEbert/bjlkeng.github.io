    "One of the most common probability distributions is the normal (or Gaussian) distribution.  Many natural phenomena can be modelled using a normal distribution.  It's also of great importance due to its relation to the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll be reviewing the normal distribution and looking at how to draw samples from it using two methods.  One naive method using the central limit theorem, and another using the [Box-Muller transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform).  As usual, some brief coverage of proofs and code will be included to help drive intuition.\n",

    "The CDF doesn't have a nice closed form, so we'll just represent it here using the definition of CDF in terms of its PDF.  We can graph the PDF and CDF (images from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)):\n",
