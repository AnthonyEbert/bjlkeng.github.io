.. description: A First Post
.. type: text

Hi all, this the first post in my technical blog.  For a long time I've resisted making
a blog about anything technical because well, to be frank, I didn't feel like I
was qualified.  What makes me more qualified now?  Nothing really, I'm just a bit less
afraid of being wrong (`Duty Calls <https://xkcd.com/386/>`_).

So maybe a good place to start is what I used to setup this blog.  For my personal
blog (`www.briankeng.com <http://www.briankeng.com/>`_), where I discuss random
worldly wisdom that I come across, I use `WordPress <https://wordpress.org/>`_.
For this one, I used something a bit more technical (because why not?): a
combination of `Github Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ and `Nikola
<https://getnikola.com/>`_ a static site generator.
