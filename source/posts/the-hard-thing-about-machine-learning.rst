I wrote a post on the hard parts about machine learning over
at Rubikloud:

* `The Hard Thing about Machine Learning <https://rubikloud.com/labs/data-science/hard-thing-machine-learning/>`__

Here's a blurb:

    Much of the buzz around machine learning lately has been around novel
    applications of deep learning models. They have captured our imagination by
    anthropomorphizing them, allowing them to dream, play games at superhuman
    levels, and read x-rays better than physicians. While these deep learning
    models are incredibly powerful with incredible ingenuity built into them,
    they are not humans, nor are they much more than “sufficiently large
    parametric models trained with gradient descent on sufficiently many
    examples.” In my experience, this is not the hard part about machine
    learning.

    Beyond the flashy headlines, the high-level math, and the computation-heavy
    calculations, the whole point of machine learning — as has been with
    computing and software before it — has been its application to real-world
    outcomes. Invariably, this means dealing with the realities of messy data,
    generating robust predictions, and automating decisions.

    ...

 
    Just as much of the impact of machine learning is beneath the surface, the
    hard parts of machine learning are not usually sexy. I would argue that the
    hard parts about machine learning fall into two areas: generating robust
    predictions and building machine learning systems.

Enjoy!
