    "Games and gambling have been part of human cultures around the world.  Nowadays, the connection between games of chance and mathematics (in particular probability) are so obvious that it is taught to school children.  However, the mathematics of games and gambling only started to formally [develop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling#History) in the 17th century with the works of multiple mathematicians such as Fermat and Pascal.  It is then no wonder that many incorrect beliefs around gambling have formed that are \"intuitive\" from layman's perspective but fail to pass muster when applying the rigor of mathematics.\n",
