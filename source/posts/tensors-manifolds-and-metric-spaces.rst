This post is going to take a step back from some of the machine learning
topics that I've been writing about recently and go back to some basics: math!
In particular, tensors, manifolds and metric spaces.  These are all topics that
are casually mentioned in machine learning papers but for those of us who never
took advanced geometry or topology courses (*cough* computer engineers), it's a
bit murky trying to understand what's going on.  
So on my most recent vacation, I started reading a variety of sources on the
interweb trying to piece together a picture of what these topics were all
about.  As usual, I'll skip the formalities (partly because I probably couldn't
do them justice) and try to explain the intuition instead.  I'll sprinkle in
a bunch of examples and also try to relate it back to ML where possible.
Hope you like it!
