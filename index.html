<p>I have something to admit: I've never done any serious programming in a
functional language.  Yes, yes, I've done some small school assignments in
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a> (a
dialect of Lisp), even helping out my friend from another university with his
Scheme assignment but nothing <em>real</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/functions-and-procedures/#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>.  Does this
make me a worse programmer?  Probably not, I imagine most developers haven't
done anything <em>real</em> with functional programming.  Although that's probably not
what you'd expect from reading <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>,
where you don't know programming if you haven't tried Clojure or Haskell <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/functions-and-procedures/#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>My position is much more pragmatic: I'm interested in tools and techniques that
help me solve problems faster, cleaner and with less headache.  Ideas and
concepts from functional programming languages are <em>supposed</em> to help with at
least some of that -- and they do; they're just not a panacea for all your
programming woes.  Like most things a solid grasp of the fundamentals goes a
long way.  So the topic of this post is about something pretty fundamental: a
subroutine.  In particular, two important kinds of subroutines:
procedures and pure functions.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p></p>
<h4> Programming is Organization </h4>
<p>Let me digress for a moment because I want to discuss an incredibly important idea
that James Hague discusses in his post <a class="reference external" href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic
Wizardry</a>.  He nails down one of the most
important points about software development: organization.  (emphasis mine)</p>
<blockquote>
When it comes to writing code, the number one most important skill is how to
keep a tangle of features from collapsing under the weight of its own
complexity... there's always lots of state to keep track of, rearranging of values,
handling special cases, and carefully working out how all the pieces of a
system interact. To a great extent <strong>the act of coding is one of organization</strong>.
Refactoring. Simplifying. Figuring out how to remove extraneous manipulations
here and there.</blockquote>
<p>As much as it is fun debating the merits of one language/framework/technology
versus another, it's much more practical to talk about ways we can organize
programs in a more efficient manner (in whatever language/framework/technology
we're currently using).  Now back to the main show...</p>
<p></p>
<h4> A Function By Any Other Name </h4>
<p>It's funny that one of the first things we learn when programming is the concept
of a subroutine: <em>a set of instructions designed to perform a frequently used
operation within a program</em>, which is supposed to help organize your program.
Great, but I don't recall learning much about the different kinds of
subroutines or even really best practices for using them.  For some reason
that's just something you have to figure out yourself.  Let's try to be a bit
more explicit.</p>
<p>In my mind, a useful (but perhaps not universally accepted) classification of
subroutines breaks them down into two general categories: procedures and pure
functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <cite>procedure</cite> is a sequence of commands to be executed.  These are
usually used for <cite>doing stuff</cite>.  Typically, these will involve side-effects
(such as changing the state of variables, outputting to the screen, or
saving things to a file etc.).  Procedures don't have return values.</li>
<li>A (pure) <cite>function</cite> computes a value (and returns it).  These are for
<cite>computing stuff</cite>.  Just like a function in math, for the same set of
inputs, it will always return the exact same output.  Functions don't have
side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that these are not the only two ways to think about subroutines.  There
is a type of subroutine that returns something <em>and</em> has side-effects (among
others).  But I argue that these two are the most constructive ways to think
about subroutines.</p>
<p>The most popular languages out there today don't really make a distinction
between these two types of subroutines, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't!
The reason to look at subroutines this way is because of a general rule of
thumb that I came across by Greg Ward in his talk at Pycon 2015,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9cnHO15YgU">How to Write Reusable Code</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="posts/functions-and-procedures/)https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides/tree/master/Greg%20Ward%20-%20How%20to%20Write%20Reusable%20Code">slides</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
Every [subroutine] should either return a value or have a side effect: never both.</blockquote>
<p>This is great rule of thumb that's hard to appreciate until you've made the mistake of
violating it and have it come back to bite you in the arse.  Greg goes on to give
a couple of great examples (from actual code reviews he has done).  Here's
one of his examples where this rule of thumb is violated:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-1"></a><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-2"></a>    <span class="sd">'''Query the server for foo values.</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-3"></a><span class="sd">    Return a dict mapping hostname to foo value.</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-4"></a>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-5"></a><span class="sd">    foo must be a dict or None; if supplied, the</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-6"></a><span class="sd">    foo values will additionally be stored there</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-7"></a><span class="sd">    by hostname, and foo will be returned instead</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-8"></a><span class="sd">    of a new dict.</span>
<a name="rest_code_c0e8ad5e6f5d48559971eb45004cd37e-9"></a><span class="sd">    '''</span>
</pre>
<p>Gee, I'm already confused even after reading the documentation (don't even get
me started on the mismatch with the function name).  Remember, we want to
build systems that don't "<cite>collapse under the weight of its own complexity</cite>" by
"<cite>Simplifying. Figuring out how to remove extraneous manipulations here and
there.</cite>"  Sure, giving it a second read, we can probably figure out what it does
but the fact that we need to think twice about it sure isn't helping the
complexity.  Imagine if every subroutine you wrote had this issue -- I don't envy
that code reviewer.</p>
<p>Greg goes on to give a better way to implement <tt class="docutils literal">get_foo()</tt> as a pure function:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_9813ca03f6bd4a8d8a10507f7fb36f1b-1"></a><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
<a name="rest_code_9813ca03f6bd4a8d8a10507f7fb36f1b-2"></a>    <span class="sd">'''Query the server for foo values.</span>
<a name="rest_code_9813ca03f6bd4a8d8a10507f7fb36f1b-3"></a><span class="sd">    Return a dict mapping hostname to foo value.</span>
<a name="rest_code_9813ca03f6bd4a8d8a10507f7fb36f1b-4"></a><span class="sd">    '''</span>
</pre>
<p>Much simpler and easy to understand: query the server, get back a <tt class="docutils literal">dict</tt>.
No extraneous mental overhead with the <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> parameter.  It
may only be a small improvement but when building a large system, these small
things add up quickly (especially since complexity is likely multiplicative).</p>
<p>There's also this example involving C:</p>
<pre class="code c"><a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-1"></a><span class="cm">/**</span>
<a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-2"></a><span class="cm"> * Replace all 'e' characters in str with 'E'. Return the number of</span>
<a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-3"></a><span class="cm"> * characters replaced.</span>
<a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-4"></a><span class="cm"> */</span>
<a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-5"></a><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">strmunge_v1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-6"></a>    <span class="p">...</span>
<a name="rest_code_c77c3b253823401d83a8e46896c6c467-7"></a><span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>He points out that this type of subroutine is pervasive in C and notes that the
only valid reason for violating this rule is for performance (which is probably
why you're programming in C in the first place!).  For the rest of us who aren't
writing performance critical code (come guys, that's most of you), a much
cleaner solution is not to have the side-effect and convert it to a pure
function:</p>
<pre class="code c"><a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-1"></a><span class="cm">/**</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-2"></a><span class="cm"> * Return newstr, a copy of str with all 'e' characters replaced</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-3"></a><span class="cm"> * by 'E', and nreplaced, the number of characters replaced.</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-4"></a><span class="cm"> * (Assume language with multiple return values)</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-5"></a><span class="cm"> */</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-6"></a><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">strmunge_v2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-7"></a>    <span class="p">...</span>
<a name="rest_code_d4e55fc913294672b71a46b7cd647a69-8"></a><span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>The pure function has many benefits over the side-effect-ridden one (functional
programmers rejoice!) with the main one that it's easier to reason about: you
can look at the function in isolation of the entire program.  Write it
separately, review it separately, unit test it separately.  And once you're
convinced it works properly, you don't need to look at it again!  You can now
"abstract" that function out when reading the parent functions.  Awesome!
I'm a huge fan of making things <a class="reference external" href="http://www.briankeng.com/about/">simpler</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4> Fundamentals </h4>
<p>The reason that I decided to write this post is that lately, I've been using a
"procedure of (pure) functions" type pattern in my code.  My main logic
typically is some kind of procedure that farms out much of the work to pure
functions rather than mixing them (kicking my old performance-driven C++
mindset).  I find that it's been a very useful way to structure my programs and
generally just more pleasant to read.</p>
<p>After noticing this subtle shift in my code (and after watching Greg's talk), I
rediscovered my appreciation for the fundamentals.  I get the feeling that when
people want to learn something they conflate the most advanced ideas with the
most important.  There's definitely something to be said of taking a step back
and learning the fundamentals well.  Programming is no different in this
respect.  If you want to become strong at programming, start with the
fundamentals.</p>

I'm more of the opinion that, practically, it's harder to use them to solve many of the problems out there.  It's not just the issue from learning the FP conceptual point of view but also the fact that it's not that easy to find libraries, examples or even jobs that use these languages (although obviously some do exist).  Without a good "support structure" (including monetary compensation), it's hard to justify using a functional language.</td>

<p><strong>Preface</strong>: <em>Second post and I'm already off topic according to my subtitle.  I
do have another post that is more topic appropriate but it's been pretty hectic
so I haven't had time to finish it.  Although, investing is definitely a kind of
technical topic involving data and numbers, so one could argue it is still on
topic.  And argue I shall!  Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>A lot of smart people I meet frequently mention that they have no clue about
investing or other related financial matters.  They're quite right that modern
finance can get complicated really fast such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model">option pricing models</a> (that require
differential equations and other such complicated maths) but as in most things
though, a little common sense goes a long way.  So I want to share an analogy
that I think will help people understand a rational way to invest <em>i.e.</em> value
investing.  In particular, the discussion will be geared towards investing in
publicly traded stocks but the general idea applies to most asset classes.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p></p>
<h4> Stocks: An Emotional Roller Coaster </h4>
<p>There's a huge disconnect between <em>how</em> a stock certificate is perceived and <em>what</em>
it actually represents.  How it is usually perceived is as a number.  A number
that randomly goes up and down while taking you (usually without asking) on an
emotional roller coaster ride.  The higher the peaks and lower the troughs, the
more exhilarating the ride.  Just like gambling, when emotions are involved,
it rarely turns out well (or profitable).</p>
<p>What a stock certificate actually represents is much more boring.  It
represents a part ownership in the underlying company.  That is, you are
entitled to dividends and other assets of the company in proportion to your
ownership stake.  In the limit, you own the company.</p>
<p>So I think most people can rationally follow along with this idea: stocks =
part ownership of a company.  Buying a better company, all things being equal,
is better.  Most of the time, things aren't equal though, and the biggest
thing you have control over is the the <em>price</em> you purchase the stock (you
rarely have any ability to change its underlying economics).</p>
<p><em>"Great, so I get that Brian, but how can I make money off of it?"</em></p>
<p>This is where it gets tricky.  Remember the emotional roller coaster?
Well for many people investing is kind of like trying to do
math <em>while</em> riding this roller coaster: it's hard to do right!  But what I
would like to show is how you probably already have a good intuition on how
investing <em>should</em> work.  Let's take a hypothetical example from everyday life
<a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/common-sense-and-investing/#id4" id="id1">[1]</a> and see how some common sense really matches up with a rational way to
invest.</p>
<p></p>
<h4> From Buying Groceries to Investing </h4>
<p>Most people generally know the price of common items they buy.  For items such as
toilet paper, laundry detergent or a carton of milk, most people have a general
idea of what the price should be.  For me, I have a good idea of what a
12-packs of Coke Zero costs.  The price varies, regular is $4.99 - $5.99,
sometimes when it's on sale it can go down to $3.99, and once in a blue moon it
will go down to $2.99 per case.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you could return this case of Coke whenever you want,
but not just for the price you paid, for the <em>current</em> sale price of the case.
So if you bought it on sale for $3.99 last week, you could refund it and get
back $5.99 this week when the sale is over (or vice versa).  In this
hypothetical example, you've actually made $5.99 - $3.99 = $2.00.  A return of
about 50% ($2.00 / $3.99)!</p>
<p>Although contrived, this example shows a key idea.  You have some sense of what
the case of Coke is worth.  That is, $5.99 is over paying for a case of Coke,
while $3.99 is a pretty good deal.  This is directly analogous to investing in
stocks.  If you can have a pretty good idea when a stock is on "sale", then you
can buy it, wait a little bit until the sale is over, then sell it for a profit.</p>
<p>Now here's the part where people get lost.  "Sale" means different things to
different people.  The common way to determine if something is on sale (for
everyday items) is to look at the history of its price and see when it's low
relative to regular price.  People do invest using a much more complicated
version of this called <cite>Technical Analysis</cite> where they only look at
charts (for price and other related things like volume) to determine whether or not to
buy/sell.  It doesn't make much rational sense to me so I won't talk much about
it.</p>
<p>The other big school of thought, which is much more rational, is called
<cite>Fundamental Analysis</cite> where you look at the actual characteristics of the
business (like how much money they make) and estimate what it's worth.  The key
idea here is that when determining if something is on "sale", we should have
some rational line of economic reasoning to back it up.  Let's go back to our
example of a case of Coke.</p>
<p></p>
<h4> The Cost of a Case of Coke </h4>
<p>Imagine you really wanted to understand (using "Fundamentals") what a case of
Coke was really worth.  So you call up your buddy who works at Coke, talk to
him and his friends, and you estimate that it costs Coca-Cola about $0.15 for
each can of Coke (including cost of water, syrup, aluminum, packaging,
distribution).  Further, you also call up your buddy at the grocery store and
he tells you that he buys a case of Coke from Coca-Cola for between $2.00 and
$3.00 per case ($0.16 - $0.25 per can) depending on what kind of deal he can
work out with Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Now, we have a good idea of what the minimum price of a case
of Coke given different assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Case 1</strong>: Assume Coca-Cola makes no money, grocer makes no money (just cost of
manufacturing/distribution):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost = $0.15/can * 12 cans/case = <strong>$1.80/case</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Case 2</strong>: Assume Coca-Cola sells to grocer at historic average price ($2.50; $0.058/can profit), and grocer has no profit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost = <strong>$2.50/case</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Case 3</strong>: Assume Coca-Cola sells to grocer at historic average price ($2.50/case; profit: $0.058/can), grocer wants to make $0.60/case profit ($0.05/can):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost = $2.50 + $0.60 = <strong>$3.10/case</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So with a minimum price of a case of Coke between $1.80 - $3.10, what is a good
price for a case of Coke?  Our $2.99 price isn't looking too bad right.  It
would be even better if we could get a lower price but $2.99 seems like a price
that we could reasonably sell it for more down the road (the grocer and
Coca-Cola probably will want more profit at some point down the road).</p>
<p>So in the end, our deep research into what a case of Coke costs is pretty
similar to ad-hoc technical analysis because we both see that $2.99 isn't bad.
In this case it worked out to be roughly the same but not always.  Next, let's
take a look at an up and coming beverage Zico Coconut Water.</p>
<p></p>
<h4> The Cost of Buying the Trendy: Zico Coconut Water </h4>
<p>Imagine Coca-Cola had just released their hot new product: Zico Coconut Water.
You're eager to get some, not to drink, but to buy on sale and sell at a higher
price.  So you watch the price for a 1L bottle go up and down at different
grocers for a few months.  You figure that the typical price range is $2.50 -
$5.00.  It looks like if you can buy at $2.50, you've got a great deal!  In
fact, you observe that it is so rarely at a $2.50 price point because people
can't drink enough of it (Taylor Swift drinks it!).  Most of the time it's
selling for much more.  You might even hear rumours that it could go high as
$6.00/bottle.  So question: buy or not buy at $2.99?</p>
<p>Not buy.  Here's why (in our hypothetical example).  Coconut water was actually
just a fad.  It had the typical run-up only to fall back down in popularity
when the next big drink hit.  So to ensure that it can still move product, the
grocer and Coca-Cola reined in their profits and started selling at regular
price of $2.50 and sometimes on sale to $1.99.  The $2.99 price no longer seems
like a great deal does it?  You potentially lost $0.49 ($2.99 - $2.50)!</p>
<p>If we had done some research though, you might have avoided this devastating loss.
You might have found out that Coconut water is roughly 3x more expensive to
make that Coca-Cola.  So that's roughly $0.45/can equivalent, which translates
to roughly $1.35/1L bottle.  All of a sudden $2.99 doesn't look like a great
price, <em>maybe</em> $1.99 is more reasonable.</p>
<p></p>
<h4> Common Sense sprinkled with Economic Rationalism </h4>
<p>As I mentioned at the top, rational investing is not too far off from our
intuition when buying everyday items such as groceries: you want to buy when
things that are on sale <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/common-sense-and-investing/#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>.  The biggest mistake people make though is that
their idea of a "sale" doesn't match economic reality.  Buying should be done
when a thorough economic analysis has shown that it is on "sale".</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is a really hard thing to do.  Most of the time, the closest
you can get is a rough idea of an asset's price <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/common-sense-and-investing/#id6" id="id3">[3]</a>, so you have to factor that
into your calculations when deciding if something is on sale.  The important
thing to remember is that our intuition isn't too far off from a smart (read:
rational) way to invest: just buy when on sale.  The trick (for most people) is
that if you can't determine whether it's on sale, you probably shouldn't be
investing in the first place.</p>

<p>Hi all, this the first post in my technical blog.  For a long time I've resisted making
a blog about anything technical because, to be frank, I didn't feel like I
was qualified.  What makes me more qualified now?  Nothing really, I'm just a bit less
afraid of <a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/386/">being wrong</a>.</p>
<p>So maybe a good place to start is what I used to setup this blog and what the
domain/title mean.
For my personal blog (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.briankeng.com/">www.briankeng.com</a>), where
I discuss random worldly wisdom that I come across, I use <a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.
For this one, I used something a bit more technical (because why not?):</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></dt>
<dd>Great place to host a static website (free) but also has some of that "hacker
cred".  It's quite easy to use (if you've used git before) and also quite
well <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">documented</a>
on how to get your domain setup.</dd>
<dt>
<br><a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> (static site generator)</dt>
<dd>The recommended static site generator with Github Pages is Jekyll but one
thing I wanted for this site is to make use of <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebooks</a>.  After a bit of searching, I found
Nikola to be a good match because it supports IPython Notebooks out of the box
(as opposed to Jekyll which required some fiddling), and seemd to have a reasonably
simple setup.  The really interesting line from the <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#getting-more-themes">documentation</a>
is this quote: <tt class="docutils literal">DON'T READ THIS MANUAL. IF YOU NEED TO READ IT I FAILED, JUST USE THE THING.</tt>
Exactly the sentiment I was going for.</dd>
<dt>
<br><a class="reference external" href="https://themes.getnikola.com/#bootstrap3">Bootstrap3</a> theme and <a class="reference external" href="bhttp://bootswatch.com/readable/">Readable</a> Bootstrap theme.</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">Bootstrap3 is the default theme for Nikola, conveniently using <a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>,
the most popular HTML/CSS/JS framework for the web.  Since I'm not a very
good designer using high quality themes/framework is definitely ideal.</p>
<p>The default Nikola theme, however, was not too my liking.  A bit too spartan for me.  Fortunately, Nikola has a really cool
feature where you can take an existing Bootstrap theme from <a class="reference external" href="http://bootswatch.com">http://bootswatch.com</a>
and skin the default Nikola Bootstrap theme.  I chose the <a class="reference external" href="bhttp://bootswatch.com/readable/">Readable</a> theme because I'm
a huge fan of making things easy-to-read (you should see how large the font
size is on my devices, frequently referred to as "old people font size").</p>
<p class="last">Even with the new Bootstrap theme, the site layout didn't quite look right.
So I fiddled around with the layout and placement of items, pretty much
copying the layout of another blog I really enjoy <a class="reference external" href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/">programming in the twenty-first century</a> by James Hague.
It was interesting playing around with HTML templates and CSS but pretty much
confirmed that it's not really what I like doing.  Getting to a satisfactory
layout was as much effort as I really wanted to put in.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END --><p><br></p>
<p>As for the name of the blog, ever since I read the autobiography of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon">Herbert Simon</a>,
I've been fascinated by his idea of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality">bounded rationality</a> which is the idea that:</p>
<blockquote>
"when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited
by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and
the time available to make the decision."</blockquote>
<p>Along with this idea, Simon also gives the idea of <em>satisficing</em>, a term
combining the meaning <em>satisfy</em> and <em>suffice</em>, a stark contrast to optimal
decision making.  Not only was he quite ahead of the times applying this idea
of bounded rationality to economics/social science analysis, it also really
speaks to his strong inclination to look at reality in the most rational way.
This is as opposed to how many academics behave by trying to fit reality
into their elegant mathematical models (A pithy quote from Galbraith:
<tt class="docutils literal">economists are most economical about ideas. They make the ones they learned
in graduate school last a lifetime</tt>).</p>
<p>Simon is definitely a personal hero of mine, a true polymath.  This is quite
apparent from Simon winning both a Nobel Prize <em>and</em> a Turing award (the Turing
award was for his contributions to artificial intelligence and IPL, a precursor
to Lisp).  Beyond his massive contributions to the social and computer
sciences, his multi-disciplinary approach to problems along with a strong
tendency towards rational thinking really speak to me.  So naturally, I
don't mind lifting the terms <em>satisficing</em> and <em>bounded rationality</em> to use
as names for the domain/blog title.</p>
<p>In this weblog, I hope to apply the spirit of these two ideas, trying to
understand and explain technical subjects without getting bogged down in the
minutiae that so frequently surrounds technical subjects.  Instead, try to
focus on the ideas that actually help us move forward in solving practical
problems to a satisfactory degree (satisficing).</p>
<p>With respect to the subject area of the blog, it will probably vary quite a
bit.  There will probably be a lot of focus on programming and data science
since that's what I spend most of my time at work doing.  However, don't be
surprised if I write about other various technical subjects that interest me
such as math or investing.  Real world problems rarely fit into such neat
classifications, so why limit what I write about?  Hope you enjoy it.</p>
