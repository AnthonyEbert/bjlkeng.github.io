learning method in machine learning called variational autoencoders.  It's main
claim to fame is in building generative models of complex distributions like
handwritten digits, faces, and image segments among others.  The really cool
thing about this topic is that it has firm roots in probability but uses a
function approximator (i.e.  neural networks) to approximate an otherwise
intractable problem.  As usual, I'll try to start with some background and
motivation, include a healthy does of math, and along the way try to convey
some of the intuition of why it works.  I've also annotated a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bjlkeng/sandbox/blob/master/notebooks/variational-autoencoder.ipynb"&gt;basic example&lt;/a&gt;
so you can see how the math relates to an actual implementation.  I based much
of this post on Carl Doersch's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;,
which has a great explanation on this whole topic, so make sure you check that
out too.&lt;/p&gt;

the most common one, the mean-field approximation.  This is a topic that I've
been trying to understand for a while now but didn't quite have all the background
that I needed.  After picking up the main ideas from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/the-calculus-of-variations"&gt;variational calculus&lt;/a&gt; and
getting more fluent in manipulating probability statements like
in my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/the-expectation-maximization-algorithm"&gt;EM&lt;/a&gt; post,
this variational Bayes stuff seems a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variational Bayesian methods are a set of techniques to approximate posterior
distributions in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"&gt;Bayesian Inference&lt;/a&gt;.
If this sounds a bit terse, keep reading!  I hope to provide some intuition
so that the big ideas are easy to understand (which they are), but of course we
can't do that well unless we have a healthy dose of mathematics.  For some of the
background concepts, I'll try to refer you to good sources (including my own),
which I find is the main blocker to understanding this subject (admittedly, the
math can sometimes be a bit cryptic too).  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

variational calculus.
Analogous to the usual methods of calculus that we learn in university,
this one deals with functions &lt;em&gt;of functions&lt;/em&gt; and how to
minimize or maximize them.  It's used extensively in physics problems such as
finding the minimum energy path a particle takes under certain conditions.  As
you can also imagine, it's also used in machine learning/statistics where you
want to find a density that optimizes an objective &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/the-calculus-of-variations/#id4" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.  The explanation I'm
going to use (at least for the first part) is heavily based upon Svetitsky's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://julian.tau.ac.il/bqs/functionals/functionals.html"&gt;Notes on Functionals&lt;/a&gt;, which so far is
the most intuitive explanation I've read.  I'll try to follow Svetitsky's
notes to give some intuition on how we arrive at variational calculus from
regular calculus with a bunch of examples along the way.  Eventually we'll
get to an application that relates back to probability.  I think with the right
intuition and explanation, it's actually not too difficult, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

fits your given state of knowledge.  Using the principle of maximum
entropy and some testable information (e.g. the mean), you can find the
distribution that makes the fewest assumptions about your data (the one with maximal
information entropy).  As you may have guessed, this is used often in Bayesian
inference to determine prior distributions and also (at least implicitly) in
natural language processing applications with maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
classifiers (i.e. a multinomial logistic regression).  As usual, I'll go through
some intuition, some math, and some examples.  Hope you find this topic as
interesting as I do!&lt;/p&gt;

subject to some constraints.  This is usually introduced in a multivariate
calculus course, unfortunately (or fortunately?) I never got the chance to take
a multivariate calculus course that covered this topic.  In my undergraduate class, computer
engineers only took three half year engineering calculus courses, and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/1617/COURSE/course-ECE.html#ECE206"&gt;fourth one&lt;/a&gt;
(for electrical engineers) seems to have covered other basic multivariate
calculus topics such as all the various theorems such as Green's, Gauss', Stokes' (I
could be wrong though, I never did take that course!).  You know what I always imagined Newton
saying, "It's never too late to learn multivariate calculus!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that vein, this post will discuss one widely used method for finding optima
subject to constraints: Lagrange multipliers.  The concepts
behind it are actually quite intuitive once we come up with the right analogue
in physical reality, so as usual we'll start there.  We'll work through some
problems and hopefully by the end of this post, this topic won't seem as
mysterious anymore &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/lagrange-multipliers/#id3" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

maximum likelihood (MLE) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of parameters
in latent variable models called the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.  You
have probably heard about the most famous variant of this algorithm called the
k-means algorithm for clustering.
Even though it's so ubiquitous, whenever I've tried to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this
algorithm works, I never quite got the intuition right.  Now that I've taken
the time to work through the math, I'm going to &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to explain the
algorithm hopefully with a bit more clarity.  We'll start by going back to the
basics with latent variable models and the likelihood functions, then moving on
to showing the math with a simple Gaussian mixture model &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/the-expectation-maximization-algorithm/#id5" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

regularization.  We'll take a look at both L1 and L2 regularization in the
context of ordinary linear regression.  The discussion will start off
with a quick introduction to regularization, followed by a back-to-basics
explanation starting with the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), then on to the
maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP), and finally playing around with priors to
end up with L1 and L2 regularization.&lt;/p&gt;

collaborative filtering that we're doing at my job as a Data Scientist at

&lt;p&gt;Here's a blurb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here at Rubikloud, a big focus of our data science team is empowering retailers
in delivering personalized one-to-one communications with their customers. A
big aspect of personalization is recommending products and services that are
tailored to a customer’s wants and needs. Naturally, recommendation systems are
an active research area in machine learning with practical large scale
deployments from companies such as Netflix and Spotify. In Part 1 of this
series, I’ll describe the unique challenges that we have faced in building a
retail specific product recommendation system and outline one of the main
components of our recommendation system: a collaborative filtering algorithm.
In Part 2, I’ll follow up with several useful applications of collaborative
filtering and end by highlighting some of its limitations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

regression is how randomness is explained.  The explanations always
seemed unintuitive because, as I have frequently seen it, they appear as an
after thought rather than the central focus of the model.
In this post, I'm going to try to
take another approach to building an ordinary linear regression model starting
from a probabilistic point of view (which is pretty much just a Bayesian view).
After the general idea is established, I'll modify the model a bit and end up
with a Poisson regression using the exact same principles showing how
generalized linear models aren't any more complicated.  Hopefully, this will
help explain the "randomness" in linear regression in a more intuitive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to write about how the ever versatile normal distribution can be used to approximate a Bayesian posterior distribution.  Unlike some other normal approximations, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a direct application of the central limit theorem.  The result has a straight forward proof using Laplace's Method whose main ideas I will attempt to present.  I'll also simulate a simple scenario to see how it works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
