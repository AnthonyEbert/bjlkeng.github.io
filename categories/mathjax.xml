variational calculus.
Analogous to the usual methods of calculus that we learn in university,
this one deals with functions &lt;em&gt;of functions&lt;/em&gt; and how to
minimize or maximize them.  It's used extensively in physics problems such as
finding the minimum energy path a particle takes under certain conditions.  As
you can also imagine, it's also used in machine learning/statistics where you
want to find a density that optimizes an objective &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/the-calculus-of-variations/#id4" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.  The explanation I'm
going to use (at least for the first part) is heavily based upon Svetitsky's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://julian.tau.ac.il/bqs/functionals/functionals.html"&gt;Notes on Functionals&lt;/a&gt;, which so far is
the most intuitive explanation I've read.  I'll try to follow Svetitsky's
notes to give some intuition on how we arrive at variational calculus from
regular calculus with a bunch of examples along the way.  Eventually we'll
get to an application that relates back to probability.  I think with the right
intuition and explanation, it's actually not too difficult, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

fits your given state of knowledge.  Using the principle of maximum
entropy and some testable information (e.g. the mean), you can find the
distribution that makes the fewest assumptions about your data (the one with maximal
information entropy).  As you may have guessed, this is used often in Bayesian
inference to determine prior distributions and also (at least implicitly) in
natural language processing applications with maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
classifiers (i.e. a multinomial logistic regression).  As usual, I'll go through
some intuition, some math, and some examples.  Hope you find this topic as
interesting as I do!&lt;/p&gt;

subject to some constraints.  This is usually introduced in a multivariate
calculus course, unfortunately (or fortunately?) I never got the chance to take
a multivariate calculus course that covered this topic.  In my undergraduate class, computer
engineers only took three half year engineering calculus courses, and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/1617/COURSE/course-ECE.html#ECE206"&gt;fourth one&lt;/a&gt;
(for electrical engineers) seems to have covered other basic multivariate
calculus topics such as all the various theorems such as Green's, Gauss', Stokes' (I
could be wrong though, I never did take that course!).  You know what I always imagined Newton
saying, "It's never too late to learn multivariate calculus!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that vein, this post will discuss one widely used method for finding optima
subject to constraints: Lagrange multipliers.  The concepts
behind it are actually quite intuitive once we come up with the right analogue
in physical reality, so as usual we'll start there.  We'll work through some
problems and hopefully by the end of this post, this topic won't seem as
mysterious anymore &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/lagrange-multipliers/#id3" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

maximum likelihood (MLE) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of parameters
in latent variable models called the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.  You
have probably heard about the most famous variant of this algorithm called the
k-means algorithm for clustering.
Even though it's so ubiquitous, whenever I've tried to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this
algorithm works, I never quite got the intuition right.  Now that I've taken
the time to work through the math, I'm going to &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to explain the
algorithm hopefully with a bit more clarity.  We'll start by going back to the
basics with latent variable models and the likelihood functions, then moving on
to showing the math with a simple Gaussian mixture model &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/the-expectation-maximization-algorithm/#id5" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

regularization.  We'll take a look at both L1 and L2 regularization in the
context of ordinary linear regression.  The discussion will start off
with a quick introduction to regularization, followed by a back-to-basics
explanation starting with the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), then on to the
maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP), and finally playing around with priors to
end up with L1 and L2 regularization.&lt;/p&gt;

regression is how randomness is explained.  The explanations always
seemed unintuitive because, as I have frequently seen it, they appear as an
after thought rather than the central focus of the model.
In this post, I'm going to try to
take another approach to building an ordinary linear regression model starting
from a probabilistic point of view (which is pretty much just a Bayesian view).
After the general idea is established, I'll modify the model a bit and end up
with a Poisson regression using the exact same principles showing how
generalized linear models aren't any more complicated.  Hopefully, this will
help explain the "randomness" in linear regression in a more intuitive way.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the techniques are direct applications of topics learned in a first
year statistics course hence the "elementary".  I'll start off by covering some
background and terminology on the direct marketing and then introduce some of
the statistical inference techniques that are commonly used.  As usual, I'll
mix in some theory where appropriate to build some intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

statistics: inference and hypothesis testing.  A while back, I came to the
realization that I didn't have a good intuition of these concepts (at least
not to my liking) beyond the mechanical nature of applying them.
What was missing was how they related to a probabilistic view of the subject.
This bothered me since having a good intuition about a subject is
probably the most useful (and fun!) part of learning a subject.  So this post
is a result of my re-education on these topics.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

or gambling, even with a basic understanding of probability.  This post is going to
talk about the other side: optimal betting strategies using some very
interesting results from some very famous mathematicians in the 50s and 60s.
I'll spend a bit of time introducing some new concepts (at least to me), setting up the
problem and digging into some of the math.  We'll be looking at it from the
lens of our simplest probability problem: the coin flip.  A note: I will not be
covering the part that shows you how to make a fortune -- that's an exercise
best left to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms"&gt;Kolmogorov axioms&lt;/a&gt;,
using measure theory with concepts like events and sample space.
In one way, it's intuitive to understand how this works as Laplace
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_definition_of_probability"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable
to it, to the number of all cases possible, when [the cases are] equally
possible. ... Probability is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the
number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the
cases possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the intuition of this view of probability breaks down when we want to
do more complex reasoning.  After learning probability from the lens of coins,
dice and urns full of red and white balls, I still didn't feel that I had
have a strong grasp about how to apply it to other situations -- especially
ones where it was difficult or too abstract to apply the idea of &lt;em&gt;"a fraction
whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the
number of all the cases possible"&lt;/em&gt;.  And then I read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/physics/theoretical-physics-and-mathematical-physics/probability-theory-logic-science"&gt;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&lt;/a&gt; by E. T. Jayne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jayne takes a drastically different approach to probability, not with events and
sample spaces, but rather as an extension of Boolean logic.  Taking this view made
a great deal of sense to me since I spent a lot of time &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/accessible-satisfiability"&gt;studying and reasoning&lt;/a&gt; in Boolean logic.  The following post
is my attempt to explain Jayne's view of probability theory, where he derives
it from "common sense" extensions to Boolean logic.  (&lt;em&gt;Spoiler alert: he ends
up with pretty much the same mathematical system as Kolmogorov's probability
theory.&lt;/em&gt;) I'll stay away from any heavy derivations and stick with the
intuition, which is exactly where I think this view of probability theory is most
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
