I wrote a couple of posts about some of the work on recommendation systems and
collaborative filtering that we're doing at my job as a Data Scientist at
`Rubikloud <http://www.rubikloud.com>`_:

* `Beyond Collaborative Filtering (Part 1) <http://rubikloud.com/labs/data-science/beyond-collaborative-filtering/>`_
* `Beyond Collaborative Filtering (Part 2) <http://rubikloud.com/labs/data-science/beyond-collaborative-filtering-part-2/>`_

Here's a blurb:

    Here at Rubikloud, a big focus of our data science team is empowering retailers
    in delivering personalized one-to-one communications with their customers. A
    big aspect of personalization is recommending products and services that are
    tailored to a customer’s wants and needs. Naturally, recommendation systems are
    an active research area in machine learning with practical large scale
    deployments from companies such as Netflix and Spotify. In Part 1 of this
    series, I’ll describe the unique challenges that we have faced in building a
    retail specific product recommendation system and outline one of the main
    components of our recommendation system: a collaborative filtering algorithm.
    In Part 2, I’ll follow up with several useful applications of collaborative
    filtering and end by highlighting some of its limitations.

Hope you like it!
